Get your own API key and put it in step1.js


run `npm i` first.

then run `node step1.js` through step 6 one after another.

the step1 supports arguments for automation `node step1.js --a` to auto run using the config. else it'l ask for your own requests.

once you run step 1 through step 6, you're done.



Yada yada, no copyright bullshit, dont blame me if ur PC dies. I don't provide any support. and get your own api key.
